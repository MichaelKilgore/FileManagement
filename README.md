Synopsis:\
	This project takes the given Music folder and outputs the following statistics:\
		-Total tracks\
		-Total Artists\
		-A list of the multi-genre artists\
		-A list of Multi-disk albums\
		-A list of multi-genre artists\
		-A list of multi-disk albums\
		-A list of possible duplicate albums\
	The program performs all the tasks above using bash and the awk command.\
	
Usage:\
	To use this program just run the script folder with the Music folder as a input to the program.\
	i.e. "./script.sh Music/" Then the program will ask to enter either 1 or 2.\

Limitations:\
	The program only works on music folders structured almost identical to the Music/ folder, because the script uses depth to asses.
